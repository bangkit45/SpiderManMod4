<p>I have a great mod for those who want to see Minecraft Spider Men and other heroes of this comic in the game world.<br /><br />Spider-Man Addon adds new mobs. It will be a spider man and his enemies. You could see them in films, cartoons or comics. Now these super heroes appear in Minecraft Bedrock. Each mob will have its own properties, level of health and attack. And also some super abilities. I hope these creatures will be able to diversify your survival.</p>
